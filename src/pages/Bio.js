        In 2012 I came accross a message posted on the door of a teacher of mine
        that I had at a community college in Chicago. I'll never forget it for
        as long as live. The message has been playing on repeat in my head,
        NONSTOP, ever since I graduated from UIC in 2015...

          A man was out in the desert when a voice said to him, “Pick up some
          pebbles and put them in your pocket, and tomorrow you will be both
          sorry and glad.” The man obeyed. He stooped down and picked up a
          handful of pebbles and put them in his pocket. The next day he reached
          into his pocket and found diamonds and rubies and emeralds. And he was
          both glad and sorry. Glad that he had taken some and sorry that he
          hadn’t taken more. And so it is with education.

        I'm former World Class Athlete, turned Fitness Training Coach, turned
        Software Engineer. After losing my leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009,
        I had finally found my way in my newly amputated life in 2012, when I
        was introduced to the sport of ParaTriathlon. Here, I would be racing
        against other athletes with the same level of disability as myself
        (above-knee amputee). In the year 2015 I had hit my personal peak with
        athletics getting a Gold medal at National championships, Silver medal
        at World Championships, a Bronze medal at Continental Championships and
        I became the first single-leg above-knee amputee to ever run a sub 20:00
        5k in the entire World. After that, I ran my own fitness training and
        coaching business for 5 years. Using my education in Kinesiology, paired
        with my story of inspiration, my business flourished!

        But then sadly, due to Covid-19, my business was brought to a screeching
        hault. And that's when I thought,
        <em>"Why don't I learn how to write software??"</em> My favorite clients
        were always developers, so asking them for advice on the matter only
        seemed natural. After just 1 month of fully immersing myself in
        something that I originally knew nothing about, I came to realize that I
        had finally found the pebbles that I've been longing for.
